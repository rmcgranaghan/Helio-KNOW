APIs, widgets, or GUIs for interacting with the heliophysics knowledge graphs and commons.

### User_Interface_with_Interactive_Knowledge_Graph
The code in this directory was contributed by Swapnali Yadav (@SwapnaliY16). It was developed as a frontend user interface for a community knowledge graph created for the [NASA Center for HelioAnalytics](https://helioanalytics.io/). 


### data_availability_dashboard 
(currently only in exploration stage) tools to gather metadata on Heliophysics missions data and display data availability. Intended to have similar functionality as the [Swarm-Aurora service](https://swarm-aurora.com) and particularly their [data avilability tool](https://swarm-aurora.com/availability/)
