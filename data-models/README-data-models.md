Definitions and implementations of standardized data models and ontologies for Heliophysics. This should include the standardized models themselves, if not hosted elsewhere, alongside governance guidelines.

### 'hk' models
These refer to data models that directly build the Heliophysics KNOWledge Network (Helio-KNOW). 
- Latest phenomena ontology always **hk_core.ttl**
- Latest region-based taxonomy always **hk_region.ttl**

### heliodata_region_taxonomy
a region-based taxonomy covering Heliophysics that was developed in collaboration between knowledge engineers and Heliophysicists, is used by the helio.data website, and (future) to be integrated into the unified astronomy thesaurus. v3.0 is a sort of transition model that goes beyond what was used for helio.data and moves toward broader utility (such as UAT). It was renamed to 'hk' to refer to this updated version as a piece of the 'helio-know' semantic artifacts. The version in use on helio.data is an earlier and tailored version of the region-based taxonomy. 

### CfHA Ontology
A new ontology that supports more cohesive communities and the ethnographic design process developed by the Center for HelioAnalytics and described in:

Mcgranaghan, Ryan et al. “[The cultural-social nucleus of an open community: A multi-level community knowledge graph and NASA application](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590197423000319).” Applied Computing and Geosciences (2023).


### ADS_Enrichment
In the directory 'ADS_Enrichment' there are numerous Helio data-models that are provided and used.
