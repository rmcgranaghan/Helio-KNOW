Definitions and implementations of standardized data models and ontologies for Heliophysics. This should include the standardized models themselves, if not hosted elsewhere, alongside governance guidelines.


### heliodata_region_taxonomy
a region-based taxonomy covering Heliophysics that was developed in collaboration between knowledge engineers and Heliophysicists, is used by the helio.data website, and (future) to be integrated into the unified astronomy thesaurus

### CfHA Ontology
A new ontology that supports more cohesive communities and the ethnographic design process developed by the Center for HelioAnalytics and described in:

Mcgranaghan, Ryan et al. “[The cultural-social nucleus of an open community: A multi-level community knowledge graph and NASA application](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590197423000319).” Applied Computing and Geosciences (2023).
