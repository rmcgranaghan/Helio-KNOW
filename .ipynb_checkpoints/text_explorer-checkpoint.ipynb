Principal Investigator (PI) name, institution, and proposal title are also \\nincluded. 50 proposals were reviewed in response to this opportunity. On April 1, 2019, 11 \\nproposals were selected for funding.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nHaihong Che/University of Maryland, College Park  \\nElectron Heating and Plasma Emission in the Solar Corona  \\n \\nNanoflares heating has been recognized as an important process that contributes to the heating of \\nthe solar corona, particularly to electron heating in the lower corona. Similar to solar flares, \\nnanoflares are also a type of impulsive magnetic reconnection (MR), typically with a strong \\nguide field. It is still poorly understood how nearly collisionless MRs efficiently transform \\nmagnetic energy into the non-thermal energy of particles with power-law energy distributions \\nand form particle beams. Beams can become unstable to a beam instability and produce coherent \\nplasma emission, manifested as solar radio bursts, and become a part of non-thermal hot plasma \\nin the corona. Three fundamental questions need to be addressed regarding particle heating and \\nacceleration in flares: 1) How are charged particles accelerated in MR with a strong guide field, \\nand what determines the power-law electron energy distribution? 2) How do guide field MR \\nproduce particle outflows/beams? 3) How do particle beams produce electron heating and \\ncoherent plasma emission?  \\n \\nThe PI and collaborators have investigated various aspects of these problems using kinetic \\ntheory, numerical modeling, and multi-wavelength observations. The emerging paradigm for \\nparticle acceleration in MR is the so-called multi-island MR. The PI and collaborators showed \\nthat Fermi acceleration by contraction and merging of magnetic- islands or flux tubes is the \\nprimary cause of electron acceleration. Using kinetic theory, Zank and his group have developed \\na general formulation to describe the power-law energy spectra of energetic particles in a super-\\nAlfvenic flow. We have also developed theoretical models of electron heating in streaming \\ninstabilities in strong guide field MR. Benz has discovered a new class of Type III radio bursts \\nassociated with ion beams. The PI conducted a comprehensive study of the nonlinear evolution \\nof electron two-stream instability driven by electron beams, and provide a self-consistent model \\nfor Type III radio bursts in which coherent plasma emission is continuously generated by cyclic \\nLangmuir collapse.  \\n \\nWe will expand our ongoing studies by integrating kinetic theory, Particle-in-cell (PIC) \\nsimulations, test particle simulations, and observations. We will extend the Zank acceleration \\nmodel to sub-Aflvenic flow in the solar corona; use the analytical model and PIC simulations to \\nexplore the mechanism of particle acceleration and heating in flares.  \\n\\n\\n\\nWe will study the formation of electron beams due to magnetic focusing using test particle \\nsimulations in MHD loop-loop and interchange MR configurations. We will extend our \\nsuccessful research on radio bursts, to consider the effects of ion beams. We will investigate the \\ngeneration of Alfvenic waves and how multi-scale wave-wave interactions lead to Alfvenic wave \\nenergy cascade and the subsequent electron heating. We will also study the electron-ion beam \\ncoupling and examine how the coupling affects the properties of radio bursts, e.g., how ion \\nbeams cause the observed slow drift Type III bursts. We will also study the electron acceleration \\nand Langmuir collapse in magnetopause MR with in situ observations from MMS.  \\n \\nThe goal of this proposal will be achieved through a large collaboration among several groups 1) \\nPI and a postdoc; 2) Zank’s group including two graduates; 3) Benz and the SO (STIX) group; 4) \\nDahlin and Antiochos’ group, and 5) Boardsen and MMS group. We will use two state-of-art \\nPIC codes P3D and VPIC and a numerical code of kinetic transport equation. The proposed \\nresearch is directly related to the first and fourth science goals of the Heliophysics Decadal \\nsurvey: 1) Sun\\'s activity and predict the variations in space; 4) fundamental processes within the \\nheliosphere and throughout the universe.  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nMichael Hartinger/Space Science Institute  \\nCoordinated investigation of the link between ULF waves and geoelectric fields that drive \\ngeomagnetically induced currents  \\n \\nGeomagnetic perturbations related to a variety of phenomena in the near-Earth space \\nenvironment induce electric fields at the Earth s surface. These \"geoelectric\" fields in turn drive \\npotentially damaging geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) in technological infrastructure \\nsuch as railroads, pipelines, submarine cables and power grids. The spatio-temporal specification \\nof geoelectric fields is needed to improve forecasts of GIC, and the combination of ground \\nconductivity measurements and the time rate of change of the magnetic field (dB/dt) can be used \\nto estimate the geoelectric field. Pulsations, or waves, at the lower end of the Ultra Low \\nFrequency (ULF) band in the coupled magnetosphere- ionosphere (M-I) generate periodic \\nground magnetic perturbations and dB/dt that have been linked to geoelectric fields and GIC. A \\nbetter understanding of the role of ULF waves in generating geoelectric fields is thus needed to \\nimprove GIC models and forecasting capabilities.  \\n \\nWe propose a coordinated investigation using satellite measurements, coherent scatter radars \\n(SuperDARN), ground magnetometers, magneto-telluric surveys and geoelectric field \\nmeasurements to address the over-arching science question, \"How do ULF waves in the M-I \\nsystem couple to geoelectric field variations relevant to GIC?\" with sub-questions \"What are the \\nspatial/temporal scales of dB/dt and geoelectric fields associated with different ULF wave \\nmodes? What combinations of ULF wave properties, driving conditions, and local ground \\nconductivities are associated with the largest dB/dt and geoelectric fields?\" By examining how \\nULF waves couple through the M-I system to ground dB/dt, this study addresses the high-level \\ndecadal survey Goal 2, \"Determine the dynamics and coupling of Earth’s magnetosphere, \\nionosphere, and atmosphere and their response to solar and terrestrial inputs,\" is consistent with \\nthe NASA Heliophysics Division strategic objective to \"understand the Sun and its interactions  \\n\\n\\n\\nwith the Earth and the solar system, including space weather\" (NASA Heliophysics Roadmap), \\nand complements efforts by the NASA LWS Institute GIC group. \\n  \\nWe will address the science questions through a combination of (1) estimates of ULF geolectric \\nfields obtained from a meta-analysis of previous ULF wave studies and magneto-telluric \\nimpedance measurements, (2) global measurements of ULF wave properties used to obtain \\ngeoelectric fields in detailed case studies, (3) statistical analysis of co-located ground magnetic \\nand geoelectric field measurements. The PI is qualified for this study due to (1) research \\ncontributions that demonstrate ULF wave expertise and ability to explore new scientific ideas \\nthat will impact the ULF wave and GIC research fields and (2) current leadership activities that \\ndemonstrate ability to develop ULF wave themes, lead community in new directions, and mentor \\njunior researchers.  \\n \\nThis investigation is timely as it uses several recently available datasets to provide new \\nconstraints on ULF wave impacts on geoelectric fields/GIC. Through ULF wave expertise and \\ncurrent leadership activities (e.g., GEM ULF wave focus group), the PI is well-positioned to \\ncommunicate new results to both the ULF wave and GIC modeling research groups, fostering \\ncross-discussion between these communities and focusing future modeling/observation efforts on \\nULF wave modes most likely to generate significant GIC.  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nSeth Dorfman/Space Science Institute  \\nProperties and Dynamics of ULF Waves in the Ion Foreshock  \\n \\nBackground:  \\nWaves generated by accelerated particles are important throughout our heliosphere. These \\nparticles often gain their energy at shocks via Fermi acceleration. At the Earth\\'s bow shock, this \\nmechanism accelerates ion beams back into the solar wind; the beams can then generate ultra \\nlow frequency (ULF) waves when they interact with the backround solar wind plasma. These \\nwaves can influence space weather all the way down to the ground and represent a natural \\nlaboratory for future turbulence-relevant non- linear studies. Despite a clear connection between \\nthe beam and the waves, the mechanisms responsible for the properties and dynamics of the \\nobserved ULF waves are still a matter of debate. For example, evolution of the observed \\nfrequencies in time and space may be due to a) fast changes in the beam properties or b) a non-\\nlinear parametric instability of the ULF waves. We propose to elucidate this and other key \\nphysics using a novel combination of ARTEMIS in conjunction with other spacecraft, the \\nVlasiator global hybrid-Vlasov simulation code, and a new arbitrary distribution function \\ndispersion solver. The results will be applicable to shocks elsewhere in the heliosphere and thus \\nmay inform present and future NASA missions. Central Question: What physical processes are \\nresponsible for the properties and dynamics of ULF waves in the ion foreshock?  \\n \\nScience Goals:  \\n1) Determine the global structure and local properties of ULF waves in the ion foreshock from \\nthe wave source region to the bow shock. Is the general structure seen in Vlasiator runs  \\n\\n\\n\\nconsistent with a database of cases from ARTEMIS and other spacecraft or are there significant \\ndifferences in the key properties and dynamics?  \\n2) Determine how the observed ULF waves are related to the beams of reflected plasma ions \\nwhich generate the waves. How do changes in the beam properties in time and space influence \\nthe growth rate, spectrum, and other wave properties?  \\n3) Examine the role of parametric instabilities in the ion foreshock. Are these processes present \\nand if so do they play a key role in the observed ULF wave dynamics?  \\n \\nRelevance:  \\nThe proposed study is relevant to all four decadal survey goals:  \\nGoal 1) Results of this study will help predict variations in the space environment in the ion \\nforeshock and coupled regions of the magnetosphere of both Earth and other planets.  \\nGoal 2) The ion beam and associated ULF waves represent a response of the Earth\\'s \\nmagnetosphere to solar input. A more complete understanding of this response will be obtained \\nby carrying out the proposed study.  \\nGoal 3) The proposed research will help us understand similar shocks that determine the \\ninteraction of the solar wind with the solar system and the interstellar medium.  \\nGoal 4) Ion beam-wave interactions and parametric instabilities are fundamental processes that \\noccur both within the heliosphere and throughout the universe. We aim to characterize these \\nprocesses using the Earth\\'s ion foreshock region as our laboratory.  \\n \\nMethodology:  \\nWe propose to employ a combination of scientific techniques:  \\n1) Observations: The two ARTEMIS spacecraft, supplemented by data from ACE, Wind, \\nCluster, and Geotail, provide a unique opportunity to study the local properties and global \\ndynamics of ULF waves starting from the region where they are first generated by the ion beam.  \\n2) Simulations: The Vlasiator hybrid-Vlasov simulation code allows for simulation of the entire \\nnear-Earth space including noise-free ion kinetic effects. This allows for detailed space-time \\nresolution of both the ULF waves and the ion distributions in the foreshock that may be \\ncompared to observations.  \\n3) Theory: Both a simple Maxwellian dispersion solver and a new arbitrary distribution function \\ndispersion solver will be employed to find wave frequency and growth rates from observed and \\nsimulated ion distributions. \\n \\n\\n  \\nMcArthur Jones/Naval Research Lab  \\nTeleconnecting climate change: How do changing dynamics in the lower atmosphere \\nimpact the upper atmosphere?  \\n \\nScience Goals:  \\nSimilar to the troposphere, increases in carbon dioxide are one of the major drivers of \\nanthropogenic climate change in the thermosphere and ionosphere (TI) system. However, \\nbecause the TI is a driven system, teleconnections with changes in variability in other \\natmospheric layers should also be considered. Lower atmospheric wave forcing of the TI system \\nis now widely recognized as an important driver of space weather; however, the role of these \\n\\n\\n\\nwave motions for changing space climate remain unexplored. With the advancement of whole \\natmosphere modeling and existence of long-duration composition, wind, and temperature \\nmeasurements, it is possible to investigate the teleconnections between TI climate change and \\nlong-term changes in lower atmospheric wave forcing. The objective of this proposal is to \\nuncover and quantify the effects of anthropogenic climate change on the lower atmospheric wave \\nspectrum impinging on the upper atmosphere. The proposed study will answer the following \\nscience questions:  \\n \\n1. What long-term changes in lower atmospheric wave activity are produced by increased \\nanthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases? \\n  \\n2. What mechanisms couple the lower atmospheric wave forcing changes to long-term amplitude \\nand phase changes in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere region?  \\n \\n3. To what extent does the changing whole-atmosphere tidal and planetary wave spectrum \\ncontribute to long-term changes in the structure, composition, and electrodynamics of the \\nmesosphere, thermosphere, and ionosphere?  \\n \\nData and Methodology:  \\nThe proposed effort will be carried out primarily through model-data comparisons. The models \\nto be employed as part of this study include the NCAR WACCM-X, TIE-GCM, and TIME-\\nGCM. Validation of long-term trends in the lower atmospheric wave spectrum from WACCM-X \\ncomposition, winds, and temperatures extending up to ~100 km will be performed by comparing \\nmodel results with the extensive reanalysis, ground- and space- based datasets, including \\nMERRA-2, meteor wind radars, incoherent scatter radars, NASA AURA-MLS, TIMED-SABER \\nand -TIDI; UARS-WINDII, -HRDI, and - HALOE; TOMS; and SBUV. To evaluate the \\nmechanisms responsible for driving long- term changes in lower atmospheric waves numerical \\nexperiments with the TIME-GCM will be performed. TIME-GCM lower boundary and middle \\natmosphere winds, temperature, and composition, will be modified and tuned (i.e., nudged) using \\nWACCM- X to deduce climate driven changes in wave sources compared to climate driven \\nchanges in wave filtering by the changing background atmosphere. Estimates of lower \\natmospheric wave effects associated with anthropogenic climate change will have on the TI \\ndynamics and composition will be analyzed using numerical experiments with WACCM-X \\nfollowing future climate scenarios.  \\n \\nRelevance:  \\nThe challenges identified in the proposed study will address the Heliophysics Decadal Survey \\ngoal to \"Determine the dynamics and coupling of Earth\\'s magnetosphere, ionosphere, and \\natmosphere and their response to solar and terrestrial inputs.\" Additionally, the proposed study \\nwill address Atmosphere-Ionosphere-Magnetosphere Interactions (AIMI) Science Challenges 3 \\nand 4: \"Understand how forcing from the lower atmosphere, via tidal, planetary, and gravity \\nwaves influences the ionosphere and thermosphere\" and \"Determine and identify the causes for \\nlong-term (multi-decadal) changes in the AIM system\", following AIMI Imperatives 3 and 4: \\n\"Integrate data from a diverse set of observations across a range of scales, coordinated with \\ntheory and modeling efforts, to develop a comprehensive understanding of plasma-neutral \\n\\n\\n\\ncoupling processes and the theoretical underpinning for space weather prediction\", and \"Conduct \\na theory and modeling program that incorporates accumulated understanding and extends the  \\nlegacy of observations into physics-based models that are utilized for new scientific insight and \\noperational specification and forecast capabilities.\"  \\n\\n \\n \\nWeichao Tu/West Virginia University  \\nThe Effect of Anomalous Magnetic Field Geometries on the Dropout of Radiation Belt \\nElectrons  \\n \\nRelativistic electron flux in the Earth s radiation belt are observed to drop by orders of magnitude \\non timescales of a few hours. Where do the electrons go? This is one of the most compelling \\noutstanding questions in radiation belt studies. Radiation belt electrons can be lost either by \\ntransport across the magnetopause into interplanetary space or by precipitation into the \\natmosphere. Traditional mechanisms such as magnetopause shadowing and wave-particle \\ninteraction induced outward radial diffusion and pitch angle diffusion have been included to \\nmodel the fast loss of radiation belt electrons. However, in many cases, the observed fast \\ndropouts are still not well explained, calling for the implementation of new physical processes. \\n  \\nRecently, nonadiabatic transport of energetic electrons due to anomalous geometries of magnetic \\nfield has been suggested to play a major role in the loss of radiation belt electrons. The \\nmechanisms include magnetic field line curvature (FLC) scattering, drift orbit bifurcation \\n(DOB), and magnetopause shadowing (MPS). Recent studies have shown that these anomalous \\nmagnetic field geometries can make significant contribution to the dropout of radiation belt \\nelectrons, either by fast pitch angle scattering into the atmosphere or fast radial transport to the \\nmagnetopause. However, FLC scattering and DOB have not been well quantified due to the lack \\nof direct test particle simulations of their cumulative effects on electrons. Thus, these two \\nprocesses have not been physically included in radiation belt models. MPS has been included in \\nradiation belt models by specifying the last closed drift shell (LCDS) of electrons. However, the \\nLCDS defined in previous models usually ignored the bifurcation drift shells between closed and \\nopen drift shells, leading to unrealistic representation of MPS.  \\n \\nHere, we propose to perform direct test particle simulations of the cumulative effects of FLC \\nscattering, DOB, and MPS on radiation belt electrons. Based on the simulation results, we will \\ndetermine physical quantification of these effects and incorporate them into the new DREAM \\ndiffusion-advection model. By turning on and off individual loss mechanism in the model and \\ncomparing the model results with real-time observations, we will quantify the relative \\ncontributions of FLC scattering, DOB, and MPS to radiation belt dropout. The proposal is timely \\nfor the unprecedented high-resolution and global electron and wave data from NASA Van Allen \\nProbes, THEMIS, and MMS that cover the entire outer belt all the way to the magnetopause, \\nwhich will provide an excellent test to our model results. Specifically, we will address the \\nfollowing compelling science questions:  \\n \\n1. When and where do the three different types of anomalous magnetic field geometries cause \\nsignificant loss of radiation belt electrons? How does the effect vary with solar wind conditions, \\ngeomagnetic configurations, electron pitch angle, and energy?  \\n\\n\\n\\n2. Are the FLC scattering and DOB of radiation belt electrons a diffusion or advection process or \\na mix of both? What are the resulting diffusion and advection rates?  \\n \\n3. What are the relative importance of electron losses due to anomalous magnetic field \\ngeometries (FLC scattering, DOB, and MPS) for the dropout of radiation belt electrons \\ncompared with other loss mechanisms?  \\n \\nThe proposal directly addresses the 2nd science goal of the Heliophysics Decadal survey: \\nDetermine the dynamics and coupling of Earth’s magnetosphere, ionosphere, and atmosphere \\nand their response to solar and terrestrial inputs . It is also relevant to the 4th goal: Discover and \\ncharacterize fundamental processes that occur both within the heliosphere and throughout the \\nuniverse since nonadiabatic electron transport due to anomalous magnetic field geometries is a \\nfundamental process that occurs universally. The proposed activities are innovative, and the PI \\nhas demonstrated compelling potential for scientific leadership.  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nChristina Kay/Catholic University of America  \\nToward Real-Time Modeling of the Propagation and Magnetic Field of Coronal Mass \\nEjections from the Sun to the Earth \\n  \\nCoronal mass ejections (CMEs) cause the most significant space weather effects near the Earth \\nand throughout the rest of the solar system. These rapid, extreme changes in plasma and \\nmagnetic field can cause effects in the atmosphere and on the surface of planetary bodies, as well \\nas threaten any nearby space borne technologies. Mitigating these effects requires knowing if and \\nwhen a CME may impact, as well as the CME s properties upon impact.  \\n \\nKay et al. (2013, 2015) developed Forecasting a CME’s Altered Trajectory, a model for the \\nnonradial motion of CMEs close to the Sun. ForeCAT simulates both deflection, a change in a \\nCME s latitude or longitude, and rotation, a change in the CME s orientation. Numerous studies \\nhave shown that ForeCAT reproduces the deflection and rotation of observed CMEs (e.g. Kay et \\nal. 2016, 2017a, Capannolo et al. 2017).  \\n \\nBuilding upon the success of ForeCAT, Kay et al. (2017b) introduced the ForeCAT In situ Data \\nObserver (FIDO). FIDO uses the results from ForeCAT to position and orient a magnetic flux \\nrope as it passes over an observer yielding synthetic in situ observations. Kay & Gopalswamy \\n(2017) showed that FIDO can reproduce the magnetic profiles of near-Earth CMEs. We propose \\nto continue developing the ForeCAT and FIDO suite of models as they represent a unique style \\nof model, simple enough to run large numbers of cases, but complex enough to accurately \\nreproduce observations. We will take the remaining steps necessary to yield robust, complete \\nmodels of the behavior of CMEs between the Sun and Earth, which would then be ready for \\npotential space weather operations.  \\n \\nThe proposed work is divided into four major subtasks. First, we will incorporate preexisting \\nmodels for the arrival time to complete the Sun-to-Earth chain in our models, determining when \\nthe impact occurs. Second, we will use the properties of the active region from which a CME  \\n\\n\\n\\nerupts to determine the properties of the modeled CME, reducing the number of unknown free \\nparameters in the model. Third, we will compare ForeCAT and FIDO results with in situ \\nobservations from satellites at multiple heliocentric distances and longitudes. Finally, we will use \\nthe efficient nature of ForeCAT and FIDO to perform ensemble studies of the effects of small \\nchanges reflecting the uncertainty in the free parameters.  \\n \\nBy completing the proposed work, we will have completed a full model for the behavior of \\nCMEs from the Sun-to-Earth, allowing us to determine if, when, and how a CME may impact on \\ntimescales necessary for actual predictions.  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nMaria Kazachenko/University of Colorado, Boulder  \\nObservationally-Driven Simulations of Flaring Solar Active Regions: Energy Storage & \\nRelease  \\n \\nThe Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) from NASA provides a wealth of data showing \\nsimultaneously the magnetic field in the photosphere and the coronal response. Our ultimate goal \\nis to model flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the corona using observational input of \\nthe electric fields derived from the photospheric observations. Making this connection will allow \\nus to understand the physical causes of eruptive events. In particular, it will allow us to identify \\nwhich photospheric patterns lead to development of coronal currents and turn into the primary \\ndriver for eruptions.  \\n \\nWe propose to approach this goal through the following process. We will use two advanced \\ncoronal MHD models, the Radiative MHD Code (RADMHD, Abbett W.P. 2007, ApJ 665, 1469) \\nand the Magnetic Flux Eruption code (MFE, Fan 2012, ApJ, 758, 60), and tools developed \\nwithin the Coronal Global Evolutionary Model framework (CGEM, NASA LWS strategic \\nCapability Project, Fisher et al. 2015, SpW, 13, 369) to perform data-driven simulations of two \\nflaring active regions. The advantage of this approach is application of a well-tested PDFI \\ninversion technique to infer the electric fields from sequences of SDO vector magnetograms \\n(Kazachenko et al. 2014, ApJ, 795, 17) that are necessary to drive the models\\' photospheric \\nlayers in a manner that is physically consistent with the observed evolution. We will experiment \\nwith different temporal combinations of CGEM and MHD runs and will analyze how differently \\nspecified initial and boundary conditions affect the simulations\\' outcome.  \\n \\nWe will perform additional improvements in the electric field inversions that we use to update \\nthe model\\'s photospheric magnetic field by using synthetic data from the flux emergence \\nsimulation by MURaM radiative MHD code (Voegler et al. 2005, A&A 429, 335, Rempel et al. \\n2009, ApJ 691, 640), for which the solutions are known and performed AR simulations.  \\n \\nTo find the optimum MHD model, we will examine AR and flare properties as a function of time \\nboth in the simulations and observations, including but not limited to comparison of AIA \\nobservations with synthetic intensities and intensity proxy maps, properties of the eruption \\n(reconnected flux and flux rate, CME dynamics) both in the simulations and the observations. \\nWe will then use the most accurate MHD run to calculate magnetic energy fluxes and current  \\n\\n\\n\\ndensities as a function of space and time, pinpointing the photospheric driving pattern and the \\ncurrent evolution above.  \\n \\nThe PI, Dr. Kazachenko, has a unique science expertise and leadership position to make this \\nproposal successful. She is known for her expertise in a wide range of subjects: she is a Co-I on \\nthe CGEM project, a co-developer of one of the most advanced methods to implement \\nobservations into simulations and has deep understanding of solar observations. She organized \\nmultiple conference sessions and meetings on using solar observations to perform data-driven \\nsimulations on the Sun. She is a member of the Solar Physics Division Committee and the \\nDKIST Science Working Group. As a new faculty member at CU Boulder, through this grant, \\nshe will lead a science program integrating solar observations with simulations. This effort will \\ncreate one of the most realistic observationally-driven simulations of the flaring solar active \\nregion, allowing us to connect the observable photospheric field evolution to the evolution of \\ncoronal currents and leading to a deeper understanding of trigger mechanisms for eruptions. \\nFuture coupling of such realistic AR-scale models with global models of solar corona will \\nimprove prediction capabilities of space weather.  \\n \\nThe proposed work addresses KSG1 & KSG4 NASA goals from the Solar & Space Physics \\nDecadal Survey.  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nXiangning Chu/University of Colorado, Boulder  \\nCoupling Machine Learning Models of Multi-Instrument Spacecraft Data and Physics-\\nBased Simulations: Applications to Study and Forecast Ultra-Relativistic Electron Flux  \\n \\nThe main goal of the proposed project is to develop a coupled model that combines a first-\\nprinciples physics-based Fokker-Planck (FP) simulation with a series of machine- learning-based \\npredictive models that supply the initial, boundary and driving conditions for the FP model, to \\naccurately model the dynamics of the energetic electron fluxes in the Earth s magnetosphere. \\nEspecially interesting are the predictions of the ultra-relativistic electrons, or killer electrons, \\nwhich are responsible for damaging satellite systems and posing a serious hazard to astronauts. \\nThe main objective of our project is to answer the overarching science question: what are the key \\nphysical processes that control the dynamics of the energetic electron fluxes in the Earth s inner \\nmagnetosphere, ranging from plasma sheet (~tens of keV) to ultra-relativistic (~several MeV) \\nenergies. In addition to our main scientific goal, a number of supporting models will be \\ndeveloped which have intrinsic scientific merit in and of themselves and will produce a three- \\ndimensional near real-time description of the state of the inner magnetosphere, including the cold \\nplasma distribution, a variety of naturally-occurring plasma waves, and energetic particle fluxes.  \\n \\nThe approach of combining physics-based and machine-learned environmental models of the \\ninner magnetosphere is novel, and (to the best of our knowledge) represents a completely unique \\napplication of BIG DATA in the space sciences. Machine learning models alone cannot be used \\nto specify the extremely hazardous ultra-relativistic electron fluxes (~5-10 MeV) because the \\nobservations represent a data-starved environment, so a physics-based Fokker-Planck (FP) \\nsimulation is the only way to model the dynamics of the ultra-relativistic electrons. One  \\n\\n\\n\\nlimitation of the FP simulation is that it is sensitive to the initial and boundary conditions, which \\nshould be global and time-dependent since the electron acceleration occurs throughout the drift \\ntrajectory around the Earth. Therefore, a series of machine-learned environmental models of the \\nplasma, wave, or energetic particle environment will be developed to provide global and time-\\ndependent conditions as simulation input, which cannot be achieved using either statistical \\nmodels or in-situ measurements. This combined model will be a boon for space weather \\nprediction and will aid in insight discovery for scientific research purposes, of the key driving \\nparameters that control the hazardous near-Earth radiation environment. Each of the machine-\\nlearned environmental models of the plasma, wave, or energetic particle environments is very \\nuseful in its own right.  \\n \\nOur proposed project directly addresses the most important questions in the radiation belt \\nphysics, which is currently one of NASA’s highest priorities. The proposed research is highly \\nrelevant to Goal 2 from the Heliophysics Decadal Survey, which is to determine the dynamics \\nand coupling of Earth s magnetosphere, ionosphere, and atmosphere and their response to solar \\nand terrestrial inputs. Our proposed project addresses the timely and urgent needs of Space \\nWeather prediction, articulated in a set of recent documents including a White House Executive \\norder issued in October 2016 entitled Coordinating Efforts to Prepare the Nation for Space \\nWeather Events, which states Government must have the capability to predict and detect a space \\nweather event, the Space Weather Action Plan (SWAP) issued by the Office of Science and \\nTechnology Policy (OSTP) in October 2015 and the Space Weather Research and Forecasting \\nAct introduced as Senate Bill 2817 in April 2016.  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nKristopher Klein/University of Arizona  \\nImproved Characterization of Solar Wind Dissipation, Energization, and Stability  \\n \\nThe heliosphere is a complex system in which the transport of mass, momentum, and energy \\nfrom large to small scales and the eventual dissipation of energy as plasma heat shapes the global \\nevolution. As modeling the physical process involved at all scales is not yet tractable, we study \\nin this project the mechanisms that act to transfer energy between electromagnetic fields and \\ncharged particles using a combination of theoretical modeling and in situ solar wind \\nobservations. A number of different processes have been proposed which may mediate this \\nenergy transfer, but there is no clear scientific consensus as to which of these mechanisms \\noperate in the solar wind. Each mechanism preferentially transfers energy to or from particles \\nwith unique characteristic velocities, and may dominate the energization under different solar \\nwind and plasma conditions. In order to observationally differentiate between these proposed \\nmechanisms, we will search for distinct velocity-space signatures in particle distributions and \\nassociated electric and magnetic fields. The nature of these signatures will be motivated by \\nanalytic models and numerical simulations, which combined with solar wind observations will \\nallow us to associate particular plasma and solar wind parameter regimes with the occurrence of \\nparticular energization mechanisms.  \\n \\nThe proposed project is divided into four tasks:  \\n1) Identify instances of particular energization mechanisms operating in the solar wind from in  \\n\\n\\n\\nsitu observations using correlations between velocity-space particle distributions and \\nelectromagnetic fields.  \\n \\n2) Characterize the plasma and solar wind parameters for which different energization \\nmechanisms dominate.  \\n \\n3) Apply an alternative stability determination method to solar wind observations to ascertain \\nhow unstable the solar wind is when considering multiple sources of free energy.  \\n \\n4) Improve existing parameterized models for solar wind stability using the alternative stability \\ndetermination method.  \\n \\nCharacterizing which mechanisms act under what solar wind and/or plasma conditions will \\nimprove our understanding of the heliosphere, and enable global models of this system to \\nincorporate more physically motivated small scale physics.  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nRaluca Ilie/University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign \\nImpact of energetic heavy ions on the magnetosphere dynamics  \\n \\nThis project will quantify the relative contribution of N+ ions to the total heavy ion population of \\nthe near-Earth environment. There has been much interest in the transport and energization of \\nO+ through the ionosphere-magnetosphere system since it was first reported. However, relatively \\nlittle has been done with N+ even though past observations have established that N+ is a \\nsignificant ion species in the ionosphere, the second most dominant in the F2 region, and its \\npresence in the magnetosphere is significant. The transport and energization of N+, in addition to \\nthat of O+, have not been considered by most studies, simply because the observational record of \\nits existence and significance has been overlooked. Most past missions lacked the possibility to \\nreliably distinguish the N+ from O+ owing to their very close masses and therefore, we lack \\nknowledge of the relative contribution of N+ to the near-Earth plasma population. In spite of \\nonly 12% mass difference, N+ and O+ have different ionization potentials, scale heights and \\ncharge exchange cross sections. The latter, together with the geocoronal density distribution, \\nplays a key role in the formation of ENAs, which in turn controls the energy budget of the inner \\nmagnetosphere and the decay of the ring current. Therefore, knowledge of their separate \\nbehavior through the ionosphere-magnetosphere system can be used as a tracer for the altitude-\\ndependent transport and energization of ionospheric plasma. The main task of this effort is to \\nprovide answers to the following questions:  \\n \\n1. How does the N+/O+ ratio of the magnetospheric plasma changes in response to the solar, \\ngeomagnetic and inter-planetary variability?  \\n \\n2. What determines the spatial and temporal variations in heavy ion composition on timescales \\ncomparable to the ion drift periods?  \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n3. What role does the neutral dynamics play in the transport and losses of the ring current heavy \\nions and how does it alter the local ion composition?  \\nKnowledge of the contributions of N+ to the near-Earth plasma population will provide a unique \\nand necessary view into the differential transport of heavy ions throughout the magnetosphere. \\nTheir presence in the near-Earth environment has a profound impact on the global \\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere dynamics, especially during times of increased geomagnetic activity. \\nThey affect the global structure and properties of the current sheet, the reconnection rate and the \\nlocal properties of the plasma, and can influence the waves propagation and frequency, which \\ndepends on the mass composition.  \\n \\nThe proposed work will build a detailed understanding of self-consistent transport and \\nenergization of heavy ions in the terrestrial magnetosphere. This makes it directly relevant to \\nNASA s high-level science goals from the Heliophysics Decadal survey: 1) Determine the \\norigins of the Sun’s activity and predict the variations in the space environment; 2) Determine \\nthe dynamics and coupling of Earth s magnetosphere, ionosphere, and atmosphere and their \\nresponse to solar and terrestrial inputs; 3) Discover and characterize fundamental processes that \\noccur both within the heliosphere and throughout the universe.  \\n \\nThis project will use simulations with the Space Weather Modeling Framework together with \\nobservations from the MMS, Van Allen Probes and THEMIS NASA missions. We will conduct \\nsimulations with SWMF in various model configurations and compare model output with the \\nobservations in order to assess the near-Earth nonlinear feedback processes on the spatial and \\ntemporal structure of inner magnetospheric ion composition. Direct data-model comparisons will \\ngrant an in-depth understanding of the physical processes that control the transport and losses of \\nthese heavy ions throughout the ionosphere-magnetosphere system, allowing to quantify their \\ndistribution and the location their energization takes place.  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nReka Winslow/University of New Hampshire, Durham  \\nEvolution and interaction of transients in the inner heliosphere and their effects on galactic \\ncosmic rays  \\nThe proposed research investigates the evolution and interaction of transients as well as their \\neffects on galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) in the inner heliosphere. We leverage many years of \\nspacecraft observations from NASA missions at different heliocentric distances from Mercury to \\nMars to study the evolution of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and small flux \\nropes (SFRs), and their interaction with each other, with corotating interaction regions (CIRs), \\nand with the heliospheric current sheet (HCS)/plasma sheet (HPS). We use observations from \\nMESSENGER at Mercury, Venus Express (VEx) at Venus, Wind/ACE/STEREO/LRO near 1 \\nAU, and MAVEN/MSL at Mars, spanning heliocentric distances from 0.3 to 1.7 AU.  \\n \\nThe key science questions (SQs) addressed are:  \\n1) Does ICME complexity increase with distance from the Sun? How is ICME complexity \\naffected by interaction with other transients? Is change in complexity an inherent consequence of \\nICME propagation?  \\n\\n\\n\\n2) Is there evidence from in situ measurements, in particular from their evolution within and past \\n1 AU, that small flux ropes are of coronal or heliospheric origin? \\n3) How is the modulation of GCRs affected by ICME evolution and interaction between \\ntransients? Can reconnection of the ICME flux rope with other transients weaken its modulation \\nof GCRs?  \\n \\nThe objective of our proposed work is to develop our physical understanding of the evolution \\nand interaction of transients in the inner heliosphere, in preparation for Parker Solar Probe and \\nSolar Orbiter. A complete understanding of the changes in the properties of transients as they \\npropagate is required to understand their space weather impact at different planets and on the \\nmodulation of GCRs. The proposed research makes novel use of disparate (in terms of time and \\ntype of) datasets over large heliocentric distances from eight spacecraft missions to glean \\nvaluable insights into these currently unresolved topics that have unique relevance for all of \\nHeliophysics, but also for planetary science and astrophysics (astrospheres and stellar activity). \\nThis work is positioned for significant unanticipated discoveries and has valuable deliverables to \\nthe community: databases of 1) ICMEs observed in conjunction at the different spacecraft, 2) \\nSFRs (along with flux rope parameters), and 3) Forbush decreases (Fds) associated with ICMEs \\nwill be made publicly available.  \\n \\nTo answer our science questions, we will use a combination of solar wind, magnetic field, and \\nGCR observations in conjunction with ENLIL model simulations of the steady state solar wind. \\nWe will use well-known techniques to determine changes in the global structure of transients \\nduring propagation and their effects on GCRs, including performing superposed epoch analyses, \\nshock normal analyses, and flux ropes fits.  \\n \\nThe proposed work investigates transient propagation/interaction in the inner heliosphere, \\nleading to better understanding of ICME evolution and interaction with the solar wind and \\ntransients. It thus directly addresses the third Heliophysics Decadal Survey goal to: Determine \\nthe interaction of the Sun with the solar system and the interstellar medium. \\n\\n\\n'"

       "In June 2011, NASA requested a clarification of the survey’s scope to explicitly consider the Solar \n",

       "should not be subject to review or prioritization.2 This new request specified that the SPP mission was not \n",

       "development of SPP. \n",
       "\n",
       "To address the change in the survey’s scope, the NRC formed a study group specifically tasked to \n",

       "interest while maintaining relevant scientific and technical expertise. The Solar Probe Plus Study Group \n",
       "was led by Louis J. Lanzerotti, New Jersey Institute of Technology, who served as an unpaid consultant to \n",
       "the survey. The remainder of the study group was made up of members of the survey committee and the \n",

       "\n",
       "• Solar and planetary winds. The heating and subsequent outward expansion of the solar atmosphere \n",

       "Winds from the poles of Earth—the polar wind—can similarly fill the magnetosphere with ionospheric \n",

       "\n",
       "• Magnetic reconnection. Magnetic fields in regions of opposing field direction can annihilate each \n",

       "mergers of galaxies.\n",
       "\n",
       "• Turbulence. Plasma turbulence is ubiquitous in the space environment and throughout the broader \n",

       "one of the proposed mechanisms for heating the ambient corona and accelerating energetic particles in \n",

       "dominated by Earth’s magnetic field and radiation belt—heats electrons and ions in the auroral region \n",
       "and is ubiquitous in the charged upper layers of Earth’s atmosphere (the ionosphere). The recognition that \n",

       "Solar Probe Plus (SPP) will travel closer to the Sun than any other spacecraft and explore the innermost \n",
       "region of our solar system—the corona. The 2003 decadal survey1 recommended a solar probe intended to \n",
       "“determine the mechanisms by which the solar corona is heated and the solar wind is accelerated and to under-\n",
       "stand how the solar wind evolves in the innermost heliosphere.” The present survey found that the scientific \n",
       "rationale for a solar probe remains compelling and concluded that SPP meets that challenge. SPP will study \n",
       "the streams of charged particles the Sun hurls into space from a vantage point where the processes that heat \n",
       "the corona and generate the solar wind actually occur. SPP will repeatedly sample the near-Sun environment \n",
       "and, using in situ measurements, reveal the mechanisms that produce the fast and slow solar winds, coronal \n",
       "heating, and the transport of energetic particles. \n",
       "\n",
       "The region inward of 0.3 AU is one of the last unexplored frontiers in our solar system. Discovering how the \n",
       "solar wind originates and evolves in the inner heliosphere requires in situ sampling of the plasma, energetic \n",
       "particles, magnetic field, and waves as close to the solar surface as possible. SPP measurements will determine \n",
       "how energy flows upward in the solar atmosphere, heating the corona and accelerating the solar wind. SPP will \n",
       "also reveal how the solar wind evolves with distance in the inner heliosphere. During the past decade remote \n",
       "observations have revealed much about particle acceleration, heating, plasma turbulence, waves, and the flows \n",
       "of mass and energy in the corona. In the survey committee’s view, these observations only increase the need \n",
       "for measurements from this critical region.\n",
       "\n",
       "The current solar probe differs in several respects from the mission envisioned in the 2003 survey. The \n",
       "closest approach for SPP is 9.5 solar radii (RS) instead of 4 RS (Figure 6.1.1). The loss in proximity is significant \n",
       "but is more than compensated for by the opportunity to spend far more time close to the Sun and gather \n",
       "observations spanning half a solar cycle. This latter feature in particular makes the timing of the mission with \n",
       "respect to the solar activity cycle a less significant issue. SPP orbits in the ecliptic plane instead of a polar plane \n",
       "and thus leaves the polar regions unexplored. Nevertheless, fast solar wind streams typical of polar coronal \n",
       "holes will still be adequately sampled, albeit at larger radial distances from the Sun. Only one remote sensing \n",
       "instrument remains on SPP,  but the most significant impairment comes from the lack of in situ solar wind \n",
       "composition measurements; the survey committee urges NASA to consider restoring this capability. However, \n",

       "listed in any particular order. The requirements underlying the imperatives span five categories: spaceflight \n",
       "missions; Explorers, suborbital, and other platforms; ground-based facilities; theory and modeling; and \n",
       "enabling capabilities. Priorities within each of these categories are summarized in turn below. \n",

       "8.1.1 Spaceflight Missions\n",
       "\n",
       "No new NASA missions are under development or are currently planned for the future that address \n",

       "8.1.4 Theory and Modeling\n",
       "\n",
       "Cross-scale coupling processes are intrinsic to AIM system behavior. Phenomena and processes that \n",
       "are highly structured in space and time (e.g., wave dissipation, turbulence, electric field fluctuations) can \n",
       "produce effects (e.g., wind circulations, chemical transport, Joule heating, respectively) over much larger \n",
       "scales. At the same time, larger-scale phenomena create local conditions that can either promote or suppress \n",
       "development of rapidly changing structures at small spatial scales (e.g., instabilities and turbulence). The \n",
       "observational strategies presented in this report place high priority on understanding how local, regional, \n",
       "and global-scale phenomena couple to produce observed responses across scales. These strategies call for \n",
       "complementary development of theory and numerical modeling capabilities that enable comprehensive \n",

       "9.2.1 What Is the Magnetosphere?\n",
       "\n",
       "The magnetosphere (Figure 9.1) is a vast, highly coupled system governed by fundamental physical \n",
       "processes and characterized by complex, nonlinear linkages between its different parts. It is formed by the \n",
       "interaction of the solar wind plasma stream and its embedded magnetic field with Earth’s intrinsic magnetic \n",
       "field. Earth with its field is an obstacle in the solar wind flow, carving out a separate plasma domain where \n",
       "Earth’s field has dominant control over the motions of the electrically charged particles trapped there. These \n",
       "charged particles come from both the solar wind and Earth’s upper atmosphere. This region of dominance, \n",
       "the magnetosphere, extends out to approximately 10 Earth radii on the sunward side of Earth and, in a \n",
       "long “magnetotail,” extends to well beyond the Moon on the side away from the Sun. The shape of the \n",
       "magnetosphere is determined by the balance between the pressure exerted by the solar wind plasma and \n",
       "interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and the pressure of Earth’s plasma and magnetic field. Earth is only one \n",
       "of six of the Sun’s planets (Mercury, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) that are known to have a \n",
       "magnetosphere by virtue of their intrinsic magnetic fields. Ganymede, one of Jupiter’s satellites, also has \n",
       "its own tiny magnetosphere embedded within Jupiter’s giant one.\n",
       "\n",
       "9.2.1.1 Regions\n",
       "\n",
       "The magnetosphere is made up of regions with different plasma characteristics. As illustrated in \n",
       "Figure 9.1, the shape of the underlying geomagnetic field lines governs the morphology of these various \n",
       "regions. Nearest Earth, there is a relatively cold and dense region called the plasmasphere. The plasma-\n",
