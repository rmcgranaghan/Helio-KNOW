## How to contribute?

---

#### Understanding *where* to contribute
This repository (and the Helio-KNOW project) has many facets. We attempt to categorize the directions for development into several categories:
- NLP: *natural language processing*; This category includes tools and analysis that scrape text-based resources (e.g., academic publications) and produce insight from them
- ML: *machine learning*; Tools for performing machine learning analyses on Heliophysics data
- ontology: Tools that build and visualize the knowledge representation system/data model for Helio-KNOW data
- platform: Tools that create the interaction layer to Helio-KNOW data, tools, and resources.
- storymaps: Inspiring, immersive stories by combining text, interactive maps, and other multimedia content.
- utils: General utilities for data accumulation, wrangling, and analysis
- Knowledge_Modeling_Curriculum: Curricular/pedogogical/learning resources for knowledge modeling, which generally includes concept mapping, vocabulary harmonization, ontology development. 

These categories will remain fluid and you are welcome to suggest a change to the existing categories (create [an issue](https://github.com/rmcgranaghan/Helio-KNOW/issues)) or suggest creating an entirely new one (create [a discussion topic](https://github.com/rmcgranaghan/Helio-KNOW/discussions) for the community to converse about the addition).
