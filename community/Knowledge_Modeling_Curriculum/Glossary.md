# Knowledge Modeling Glossary

---

_This living document serves as a community and consensus-driven glossary of terms for knowledge modeling in the Earth and Space Sciences the hope to accelerate the comprehension and development of new data infrastructure and discovery tools. In cases where agreement has not yet been reached or where a plurality of views is beneficial, multiple versions can be maintained and a term in a single version may be defined multiple times. This will enable contributors to determine the best definitions to keep._
