Reusable tools for data analysis, visualization, and integration.

## List of utilities:

### tools_for_SSCWeb
Tools for accessing data from NASA's [Satellite Situation Center (SSC)](https://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/). SSCWeb is a system to cast geocentric spacecraft location information into a framework of (empirical) geophysical regions and mappings of spacecraft locations along lines of the Earth's magnetic field.

### LitNetworkBuilder
A collection of tools to aid in:
1. Harvesting a large body of papers from [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/ "ADS") using `harvester.py`
2. Recognizing papers of interest based on a list of keywords using `paperMatch.py`
3. Obtaining papers citing the recognized papers using `networkBuilder.py` and then creating a network graph and generating some graph statistics, [more info and demo notebook here!](https://github.com/oms9/LitNetworkBuilder "here")

### AutOntologyBuilder
The AutOntology tool is a tool that utilises Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology for ontology learning. It processes a text corpus, extracts relevant concepts and relationships, and outputs an ontology.


### DMSP SSJ Library: 
A set of tools for reading DMSP SSJ data and exploring them. This will serve the future development of tools to 'semantically lift' those data into a given data model/knowledge graph

### NLP
tools and scripts for natural language processing on Heliophysics texts, and eventually for becoming new sources of data for Helio-KNOW

### ML
tools and scripts for Machine Learning analyses conducted using the Helio-KNOW data/knowledge graph
