# Helio-KNOW

This repository is home to the Heliophysics KNOWledge Network (Helio-KNOW) development and community. This repo's [issue tracker](https://github.com/rmcgranaghan/Helio-KNOW/issues) also serves as a general-purpose discussion forum. Learn more details about the project below. One goal of Helio-KNOW is to bring together the research community around intelligent knowledge infrastructure and welcome all to contribute to the conversation and development. Learn how to contribute [here](https://github.com/rmcgranaghan/Helio-KNOW/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

### What is Helio-KNOW?
The Heliophysics KNOWledge Network (Helio-KNOW) is the collection of software and systems for improved information representation in Heliophysics, and the _[commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons)_ for the community to use and collaborate through them. Helio-KNOW is the technological framework for a more informed, participatory, and collaborative Heliophysics community. 

The world is increasingly interconnected and complex. The information our world now creates has placed discovery at our fingertips, but ironically the sheer amount of those data (the volume, the sources, the heterogeneity) is a crippling deluge. How do we better handle this information overload and instead harness the power of these data? 

Embrace a more natural structure for the data: a [knowledge graph (KG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph) in which the _relationships_ between data are explicit. The graph structure is more capable of holding the world's information better than a spreadsheet. It would be like trying to capture your own social circles in a spreadsheet:

KGs have altered the very foundation of many domains in the 21st century. Yet their potential has not yet been realized in many science and engineering disciplines, one of the most important to our human flourishing as a space-faring species is the space environment. What if we had a KG for the space environment and to study it's variation (i.e., Heliophysics)?

Helio-KNOW is the effort to structure information about the space environment as a KG, better organizing the data for scientific discovery and better preparing humanity to understand space. 

Helio-KNOW goes beyond simply the Heliophysics domain, growing the KG into a _Knowledge Network_, connecting to all domains:

### Description
The complexity and variability of the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere (SWMI) system, particularly the auroral high latitudes, represents a pressing challenge to the fundamental understanding of the Heliophysics system. Among the most important and yet uncertain aspects of the SWMI system is energy and momentum coupling between regions, which is accomplished by electromagnetic fields, or Poynting Flux (PF), and the transfer of charged particles.

The Heliophysics KNOWledge Network (Helio-KNOW) is a new and possibly disruptive data analytic approach for a system-level understanding and prediction of MI coupling phenomena, applicable to our diverse multi-point, multi-parameter, sparsely-sampled SWMI datasets.

Helio-KNOW brings knowledge graph approaches to create new scientific discovery, focusing on magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and creating the tools for which coupling phenomena and space weather risks can be studied.

### What is this repository?
It is both the tools (the technology) and the commons (the community exchange) to produce open, reproducible, and scalable Heliophysics science. 

The tools are the software to develop Helio-KNOW. 

The commons are the interaction via comments, issue tracking, pull requests. All are encouraged to contribute, improve, expand.
